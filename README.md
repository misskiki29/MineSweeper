# MineSweeper
💣 Minesweeper – Python Edition (Exercise 7)

Welcome to my explosive version of the classic Minesweeper game! 🚀
Built from scratch in Python using Tkinter, this project brings back the childhood stress of clicking random squares — but with clean code, colors, recursion, and lots of bombs 💥
Choose your board size, decide how brave you feel with the number of mines, and try not to blow everything up 😄

🎮 What’s inside?

✨ Fully playable Minesweeper game with GUI
💣 Randomly generated bombs every game
🚩 Flag cells to mark suspicious bombs
🔁 Smart recursive reveal of empty cells
🎨 Color-coded numbers (just like the real game!)
🏆 Win & lose detection

🧠 Cool CS Stuff Used

Object-Oriented Programming (Cell, Board, Minesweeper classes)
Recursion to reveal empty areas
Event-driven GUI with Tkinter
Randomized board generation
Game state management

🛠 Tech Stack
Python 🐍
Tkinter (GUI)
